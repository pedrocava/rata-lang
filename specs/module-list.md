# Modules to be exposed:

- [ ] Table: All logic surrounding columnar data. Much of the same API as dplyr. At implementation level, it's basically a wrapper around Elixir's explorer.
- [ ] Maps: ditto for Maps
- [ ] List: Self-explanatory
- [ ] Vector: You guessed it
- [ ] Enum: Generics for Lists and Vectors. The basic functional programming toolkit for iterating over a sequence of stuff. Map, Reduce, Keep, Discard, Every, Some, None.
- [ ] File: File system abstractions. Including reading and writing to files.
- [ ] Dataload: Utilities to read data from most used file formats like csv, xls, txt, delimited data, dta, arrow, etc.
- [ ] Datetime: Pretty much the same api as R's lubridate.
- [ ] Process: Wrapper around elixir's process module.
- [ ] Json: json toolkit.
- [ ] Struct: Wrapper around Elixir's Struct functionality.

# Interface, Runtime, Compiler, What to Implement, etc


- This language shall be mostly vibecoded into existence. I have some, very little, experience in toy projects with Elixir.
- It's supposed to leverage BEAM, OTP, and Elixir goodies like processes, macros, structs, etc, but otherwise be implemented within possibility in rata itself.
- It's supposed to be REPL-first.
- Users are to be encouraged to write their applications as modules, and arbitrarily add and complexify their submodules. The folder organization should be reflected in module/submodule hierarchy.
